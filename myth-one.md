# [](#header-1)Myth 1: Degree & Job Alignment

> ## [](#header-2)I can't apply for _this_ job because my degree is not related/I am not studying in the area.

_Nope_. In _most_ cases, your degree name will have no direct impact to your chances of eligibility. The obvious exceptions include more technical roles such as Enginneering roles, IT developers etc. For other roles such as generalist programs and roles in consulting for example, **don't even hesitate to apply** if you feel your degree doesn't fit. Companies for the most part, especially the larger companies _do not care_ what you studied.

**Top Tip:** A university degree does not set the path for what you should apply for. Rather, companies view university as the way students learn _how_ to study rather than the end product. This is a key trait that may determine if you will be successful in the role or not. 

So, if you want to work in IT consulting but don't have an IT degree? Just apply. Do you want to work in Audit but have no accounting background? No worries. All these small skills can easily and be quickly taught on the job.
