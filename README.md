## Aim
Often students say they aren't good enough for a graduate job. Some don't even apply. The most common things these people say are "My WAM is too low, I have no chance" or "I didn't study in the area so I have no chance."

We find these students f#$king annoying. We aim to help these students who feel that they aren't adequate for anything when in fact, everyone is. I just hope you, if you are one of them, have a change of heart and just apply.

## Content
Our site includes a brief summary of all these "excuses". We hope these will help you guys who are struggling to find a job or those who are battling through uni that all hope IS NOT lost! We provide a comprehensive cheat sheet for interviews that can be found on the website.
