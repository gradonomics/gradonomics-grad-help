# [](#header-1)Debunking Myths & FAQs

In this page, we aim to debunk myths that students **assume** and answer questions that students have with **graduate** programs, **internships** and **vacation** jobs. Most myths center around the _requirements_ that are needed to apply for such positions.

The purpose of collating these questions we have found is to make this website a one stop site for any enquiries any students may have. Of course, our answers will not be 100% precise. However, we have a group of 10 graduates who have shared their experience which we summarise in the best way possible.

> ## [](#header-2)Firstly, what is the difference between Graduate, Vacation and Internship Programs?

A graduate program is a _recruitment_ program of about a week to few months that is offered by companies to graduating students of different disciplines **in their final year**. It aims to give graduates opporunities in a desired profession that may involve a set program (rotating roles) or continuous employment. 

Vacation roles are roles open to students in their _penultimate_ year. Internships are generally offered whenever, aimed to give students exposure to a company or profession. 


> ## [](#header-2)Myth 1: I can't apply for _this_ job because my degree is not related/I am not studying in the area.

_Nope_. It is clear students are somewhat hesistant to apply for a job that they have not studied. For example, students believe that they shouldn't apply for an accounting job if they studied engineering because they won't be considered given they have no experience or studies in accounting. However, this is _almost_ never the case. Companies in the most part **do not care** what you studied. In KPMG for example, audit partners stipulate that the degree is often not even taken into account. 

Instead, companies look for _passionate_ students. A _passion_ for the role a student might be applying for. In the above example, the engineering student might show passion through their responses in the application, participating in student society in events to get exposure in accounting. The lesson to learn with this is, if you _want_ to work in the area, just _apply_. For sure to know though, companies will explore **why** you've applied for said job. 

**Top Tip:** A university degree does not set the path for what you should apply for. Rather, studying for university is a way for students to _learn_ **how** to study which will be applied to work. It helps aspiring graduates _learn_ **how** to learn on the job.
