<p>Frankly, those who whine about the graduate market, its competitiveness or straight out belief that they are just unhirable for various reasons, tilt us to the core. The excuses these people make can be found in our "debunking myths" section.</p>
          
<p>We hope that the Gradanomics team, recent graduates with an average WAM of 61.5, can help you find belief and just apply for jobs. No more overthinking, time to act. You only get one chance.</p>
          
<p>We offer a paid cheat sheet to help students through the interview process and prepare for all possible interview questions. If you feel you struggle in this area, our cheat sheet will be of HUGE help. </p>
          
<p>Further, we can help you refine your resume and edit it to a beautiful minimalistic design for a tiny fee. Email us at gradonomics@gmail.com for enquiries.</p>
