# [](#header-1)Debunking Myths & FAQs

In this page, we aim to debunk myths that students **assume** and answer questions that students have with **graduate** programs, **internships** and **vacation** jobs. Most myths center around the _requirements_ that are needed to apply for such positions and can be found in abundance throughout the internet, especially in public forums. 

We have not set a format for this page, rather, if one should read this whole page, they should feel more confident in (1) their understanding of graduate programs, (2) whether a graduate position is right ofr them and (3) know the myths and stereotypes that are constantly conveyed about graduate jobs.

The purpose of collating these questions we have found is to make this website a one stop site for any enquiries any students may have. Of course, our answers will not be 100% precise. However, we have a group of 10 graduates who have shared their experience which we summarise in the best way possible.

> ## [](#header-2)Firstly, what is the difference between Graduate, Vacation and Internship Programs?

A graduate program consists is a _recruitment_ program of about a week to few months that is offered by companies to graduating students of different disciplines **in their final year**. Vacation roles are roles open to students in their _penultimate_ year. Internships are generally offered whenever, aimed to give students exposure to a company or profession.
