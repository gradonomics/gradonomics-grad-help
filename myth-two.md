# [](#header-1)Myth 2: WAM/GPA Matters

--

> ## [](#header-2)My WAM is too low. I shouldn't even try applying.. I have no chance!

_We hope you don't have this approach to applying for jobs_. Our collective WAM (at Gradonomics) prove that this is not the case. With an average WAM of 61.5, min WAM of 33 and max WAM of 89, it shows that anyone with any WAM can secure any job. In fact, our lowest WAM managed to secure a job in a big 4 assurance firm.

**Top Tip:** A university degree does not set the path for what you should apply for. Rather, companies view university as the way students learn _how_ to study rather than the end product. This is a key trait that may determine if you will be successful in the role or not. 

So, if you want to work in IT consulting but don't have an IT degree? Just apply. Do you want to work in Audit but have no accounting background? No worries. All these small skills can easily and be quickly taught on the job. 

Firms (such as PwC, KPMG which have been confirmed) actually stress that degrees do not matter. Hopefully this provides reassurance for you.
